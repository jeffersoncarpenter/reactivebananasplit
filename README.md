#Reactive Banana Split

##To compile

Make sure you've got the Haskell platform and wx widgets installed.

Clone the repository.  From the root directory of the repository, run the commands

```
cabal sandbox init
cabal install reactive-banana reactive-banana-wx
```

Then you may run `make` at your discretion.

I make no guarantees that it'll be straightforward for you to get wx widgets and these two cabal packages installed.  It wasn't really straightforward for me :/
